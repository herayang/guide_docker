# Introduction
      
### 1.1 What is Docker?
      
- An open-source software platform that debuted in 2013 with the purpose of creating, deploying, and managing virtual application containers on "common" operating system.


      - Behold, The Whale.

### 1.2 How does it work?
      
- Through containers, Docker packs, provides, and runs each application accordingly.

# Docker Files

### 2.1 What is a docker file?

- A text file with instructions for creating your docker image, which is a file with executable code. It is similar to a makefile for other programming languages and  their compliers but is used for the file to work with docker. 
- This in turn provides a form of automation for creating the docker image when creating for the first time and afterwards.
- A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image.

### 2.2 Creating a docker file

- Via VS code extension, ... F1 while using the docker extension and selecting the type of file we want and its entry point (the main file it will execute)
- Via command line, touch DockerFile and vim Dockerfile to then edit it 
- docker list to view created docker files

### 2.3 Editing the docker file

FROM python:3.7 #
WORKDIR /app # Path to the image file
COPY requirements.txt ./requirements.txt # Copying our requirements.txt
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt # Runing it to install the necessary dependencies for your application to run
EXPOSE 8501 # The EXPOSE instruction tells Docker to get all its information required during the runtime from a specified Port. These ports can be either TCP or UDP, but it's TCP by default.
COPY . /app # Copy everything under the directory
ENTRYPOINT ["streamlit", "run"] # Setting the entry point
CMD ["main.py"] # Run file from the command line

# Docker Build

# Docker Container

# Docker Hub
      
### 5.1 docker push [OPTIONS] NAME[:TAG]
- docker push behaves much like Github push does. It will push any changes made up to the image it is said to push to.
- for the [OPTIONS], you have -a, -q, and --disable-content-trust
- -a pushes all tagged images up to either your local repo or your cloud repo.
- NAME is the name of your image. [:TAG] is whatever tag you want to give it, like a version number.
      
### 5.2 docker push
- docker push MYIMAGE:VERSION // docker push myimage:1.0
- If you push myimage:1.0, make a change, and then make a new one, myimage:1.1, you will be able to grab both versions, and run the differences in them. Remember, each push is a unique, read-only image. Keeping track of Version History is helpful, much like Github Commits

### 5.3 Docker Hub
- docker login --username=yourhubusername --email=youremail@company.com
- After that, you'd be prompted to login. It'll save your password through the command line.
- docker tag [IMAGEID] [DOCKERUSERNAME]/[IMAGENAME]:[VERSION] //// docker tag myimage tujianis/image:1.5.5
- docker push [DOCKERUSERNAME]/[IMAGE] will //// docker push tujianis/centos
- docker pull [IMAGE] //// docker pull centos
